This is an HTML/CSS project from the Odin Project.

This project entails recreating the Google homepage using HTML and CSS.

This is my first coding project so there was a lot of trial and error involved. It helped reinforce what I've learned so far in HTML/CSS which includes creating buttons and styling them, using the margin property to properly space elements, and creating a footer with borders and inserting text inside. A big takeaway was the importance of paying attention to detail to prevent errors such as improperly placed closing elements which would overlap styles.

I wasn't able to figure out how to insert the magnifying glass into the search bar so that's something I intend to revisit in the future.
